What is logback?
Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project. It was designed by Ceki Gülcü, log4j's founder.
It builds upon a decade of experience gained in designing industrial-strength logging systems. The resulting product,
i.e. logback, is faster and has a smaller footprint than all existing logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin.
Just as importantly, logback offers unique and rather useful features missing in other logging systems.

It assumes that levels are ordered as follows: TRACE < DEBUG < INFO <  WARN < ERROR.
