URL matrix parameters vs. request parameters?

The important difference is that matrix parameters apply to a particular path element while query parameters apply to
the request as a whole. This comes into play when making a complex REST-style query to multiple levels of resources and
sub-resources:
http://example.com/res/categories;name=foo/objects;name=green/?page=1

It really comes down to a matter of name-spacing. If only query parameters were used here, you would end up with
parameters like "category_name" and "object_name" and you would lose the clarity added by the locality of the parameters
within the request. In addition, when using a framework like JAX-RS, all the query parameters would show up within each
resource handler, leading to potential conflicts and confusion.

If your query has only one "level", then the difference is not really important and the two types of parameters are
effectively interchangeable, however query parameters are generally better supported and more widely recognized. In
general, I would recommend that you stick with query parameters for things like HTML forms and simple, single-level
HTTP APIs.
